# Business Model Canvas – EdGame v2.0

> **Snapshot of the company at full operational scale (Year 5)**
> EdGame is an EdTech platform that replaces traditional assessment and homework with immersive, game-based learning environments focused on **Math and Science**. We capture behavioral data that traditional assessments miss — how students think, collaborate, and behave under pressure — providing educators a complete picture of student capabilities.
>
> **Core insight**: Traditional assessments capture only correctness. EdGame captures *why* students get answers wrong — guessing patterns, frustration points, and which concepts need reteaching. This is the insight that Classcraft's June 2024 shutdown left a massive gap for.
>
> **Strategic approach**: Beachhead → Expand → Dominate. Start narrow (Math + Science, GCC + US Charter schools), prove value, then expand.

## 1. Customer Segments (Phased)

### Phase 1 Beachhead (Year 1–2): GCC Private/International + US Charter Schools

| Segment | Description | Target |
|---|---|---|
| **GCC Private Schools (primary)** | International and private K-12 schools in UAE, KSA, Qatar with innovation budgets and English-medium instruction | 50 school pilots → 20 paid by Year 1 end |
| **US Charter/Progressive Schools** | Innovation-oriented charter schools and progressive private schools seeking differentiation | 30 school pilots → 15 paid by Year 1 end |
| **Individual Math/Science Teachers** | Teachers who pay for classroom tools; discovered through PLG and word-of-mouth | 5,000 free → 500 paid by Year 1 end |

### Phase 2 Expansion (Year 2–3)

| Segment | Description | Target |
|---|---|---|
| **US/UK Public Schools** | Larger deals, longer sales cycles; requires efficacy data from Phase 1 | 200 schools by Year 3 |
| **Parents (B2C upsell)** | Premium behavioral insights for parents of students already using EdGame at school | 3,000 paid by Year 3 |
| **After-School Programs** | STEM enrichment, tutoring centers, coding academies | 150 programs by Year 3 |

### Phase 3 Scale (Year 3–5)

| Segment | Description | Target |
|---|---|---|
| **Districts** | US, UK, GCC district-level deals with cross-school benchmarking | 50 districts by Year 5 |
| **OEM/API Partners** | LMS vendors embedding EdGame's analytics engine | 3-5 partners by Year 5 |

**Why GCC First:** Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 is driving massive EdTech investment. Private schools in UAE/KSA have discretionary budgets, English-medium instruction, fast procurement cycles (weeks, not months), and hunger for innovation. Our team (based at KAUST) has natural access to this market.

**Why Math + Science Only:** Prodigy proved that focusing on a single subject (math) can reach 1 in 4 American children. These subjects gamify naturally (virtual labs, physics simulations, math challenges) and have the clearest measurable outcomes. Own "behavioral analytics for math and science" before expanding.

## 2. Value Propositions (Sharpened for Math/Science)

| For | Value |
|---|---|
| **Math/Science Teachers** | "See why students get answers wrong — not just that they did. EdGame reveals guessing patterns, frustration points, and which concepts need reteaching. Assign a 15-minute game instead of a worksheet; get 10x the insight." |
| **Students** | "Math and science homework that feels like a game. Solve real problems in virtual labs and challenge arenas. Your strategy matters more than memorization." |
| **School Administrators** | "School-wide learning analytics that go beyond test scores. Identify students with STEM potential for competitions, spot at-risk learners early, and benchmark across classrooms with behavioral data no other tool provides." |
| **Parents (Phase 2+)** | "See how your child handles frustration, collaborates with peers, and engages with math and science — insights you'd never get from a report card." |

## 5. Revenue Streams (Realistic)

### Year 1 Revenue Model

| Stream | Pricing | Year 1 Target |
|---|---|---|
| **Individual Teacher (Basic)** | Free (1 environment, basic analytics, 30 students) | 5,000 free users (lead gen) |
| **Individual Teacher (Pro)** | $12/month ($120/year) — 5 environments, full analytics, 100 students | 500 paid × $120 = $60K |
| **School Pilot** | $0 for 12-week pilot (skin in the game: school assigns implementation lead) | 80 pilots (conversion target: 40%) |
| **School License (Standard)** | $6/student/year — all teachers get Pro, admin dashboard | 35 schools × 500 students × $6 = $105K |
| **School License (Premium)** | $10/student/year — adds talent ID, custom reports, dedicated CSM | 15 schools × 600 students × $10 = $90K |
| **Year 1 Total** | | **~$255K** |

**Why lower pricing than original:** At launch with zero efficacy data and limited content, penetration pricing wins. IXL charges $12-20/student. EdGame at $6 undercuts while building switching costs through behavioral data accumulation. Prices increase 20-30% annually as value is proven.

### Year 3 Revenue Model

| Stream | Calculation | Subtotal |
|---|---|---|
| Individual Teacher Pro | 4,000 teachers × $150 avg | $600K |
| School Standard | 150 schools × 500 students × $7 | $525K |
| School Premium | 80 schools × 600 students × $12 | $576K |
| District packages | 15 districts × 3,000 students × $5.50 | $247K |
| Parent premium | 3,000 parents × $72/year | $216K |
| After-school programs | 150 programs × $300 × 12 | $540K |
| **Year 3 Total** | | **~$2.7M** |

### Year 5 Revenue Model

| Stream | Calculation | Subtotal |
|---|---|---|
| Individual Teacher Pro | 12,000 teachers × $180 avg | $2.16M |
| School Standard | 350 schools × 550 students × $8 | $1.54M |
| School Premium | 200 schools × 650 students × $14 | $1.82M |
| District packages | 50 districts × 4,000 students × $6 | $1.20M |
| Parent premium | 8,000 parents × $80/year | $0.64M |
| After-school programs | 400 programs × $400 × 12 | $1.92M |
| OEM API | 4 partners × $120K avg | $0.48M |
| Custom + data licensing | | $0.50M |
| **Year 5 Total** | | **~$10.3M** |

This is 58% lower than the original $24.8M but far more defensible. At $10.3M ARR with strong unit economics, EdGame is an attractive Series B candidate.

## 9. Cost Structure (Year 5)

| Category | Year 5 Cost | % of Revenue |
|---|---|---|
| **Engineering & R&D** (12 engineers) | $2.1M | 20% |
| **Game Design & Content** (5 designers, 2 artists, 2 curriculum) | $1.1M | 11% |
| **Cloud Infrastructure** | $1.0M | 10% |
| **Sales & Marketing** | $2.2M | 21% |
| **Customer Success** | $0.8M | 8% |
| **Research & Curriculum** | $0.3M | 3% |
| **General & Administrative** | $0.9M | 9% |
| **Total Costs** | **$8.4M** | **82%** |
| **Operating Margin** | **$1.9M** | **18%** |

> **Note on margin:** 18% operating margin at Year 5 is realistic and healthy for a growth-stage EdTech. The original claimed 36% which was overly optimistic. Margins expand to 25-30% by Year 7 as game library amortizes and viral growth compounds.
